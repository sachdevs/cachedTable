# cachedTable
Minimalist table in localstorage. Supports simple queries and CRUD (as of now, only CR and delete all). Mainly created for use in my other webapp, felice. Basically creates a database-like interface to interact with localstorage. I might finish this later after finishing felice since I have implemented all that I need to get felice to work.
